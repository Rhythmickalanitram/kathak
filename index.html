            <h3>kathak</h3>
            <p>Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance. The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to do with stories". Kathak is found in three distinct forms, called "gharanas", named after the cities where the Kathak dance tradition evolved â€“ Jaipur, Banaras and Lucknow. We teach here specially LUCKNOW GHARANAS.  Stylistically, this Kathak dance form emphasizes rhythmic foot movements, adorned with small bells (Ghungroo) and the movement harmonized to the music. Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.</p>
